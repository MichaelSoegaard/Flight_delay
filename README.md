# Flight_delay
_August 4, 2020_
This project is still in progress. Data based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction) Kaggle dataset. We get data from January 2019 and 2020 and need to prdict flight delays. In this project there is a lot of work in preprocessing. A lot of missing values and different categorical features. I plan to run some decisiontree models as well as a DNN model. on this dataset when it has been processed.
