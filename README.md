# Flight delay prediction
## Overview
In this project we are going to make an explanatory analysis of a dataset consisting of  as well as various models to predict
 Data based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction) Kaggle dataset. We get data from January 2019 and 2020 and need to prdict flight delays. In this project there is a lot of work in preprocessing. A lot of missing values and different categorical features. First priority was to solve this and get a get the best ROC AUC score. I tried different boosting algorithms to compare as well as an ordinary Logistic regression to use as baseline.

I used Scikit-Learn a lot including Transform, Pipeline and GridSearchCV.
